Homework 2 Made by: Miguel Angel Arcila Cifuentes 

The code was made in replit using python.

How to run the code:
Enter the number of cases:
For each case, follow these steps:
1.	Enter two numbers separated by spaces: the number of non-terminals in the grammar (k) and the number of strings to test (m).
2.	Then, enter the productions of the grammar for each non-terminal in the following format: <non_terminal> <derivation alternatives separated by spaces>
3.	Next, enter the strings you want to test one by one.
Once you've entered all the information for the cases, the program will execute the CKY algorithm for each string and display "yes" or "no" to indicate whether each string is generated by the grammar or not, respectively.
After all cases are completed, the program will end.

When running the code, it would look like this:
